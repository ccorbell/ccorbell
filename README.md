# @ccorbell readme
Hi, I'm Christopher, software engineer and devotee of music and mathematics. 

I live and work in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S., not far from Portland, Oregon.

I'm the Build & Release manager at Vectorworks where I focus on internal systems and automation using Python, Django, MySQL, AWS (EC2, S3, etc.), Xcode, Visual Studio, Jenkins, and whatever else is needed. Previously my focus was on Mac OS implementation of the Vectorworks 3D CAD product line in Objective-C and C++.

I also write Swift. Current Swift projects include MathPaint, a generative-graphics application for Mac OS. 

I'm a continuing student of mathematics particularly focused on graph theory and related domains (linear algebra, combinatorics); also interested in probability and game theory. The open-source graphoire project is a Python library for graph theory exploration.

I'm also a music composer / producer / performer active in a variety of genres, and I write poetry.
