# @ccorbell readme
Hi, I'm Christopher, software engineer and devotee of music and mathematics. 

I live and work in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S., not far from Portland, Oregon.

I'm an engineer at Vectorworks where I focus on Mac OS implementation of the Vectorworks 3D CAD product line. My focus there primarily in Objective-C and C++.

I also write Swift and Python. Current Swift projects include a generative-graphics application for Mac OS. 

I'm a continuing student of mathematics particularly focused on graph theory and related domains (linear algebra, combinatorics); also interested in probability and game theory.

I'm also a music composer / producer / performer active in a variety of genres.
